We're **Developer Experience (DevEx)** and **Developer Relations (DevRel)** specialists who've been in the trenches of web3 since before it was cool.

Here's the deal: most projects treat developers like afterthoughts. Terrible docs, broken examples, communities that feel like ghost towns. We fix that shit.

We build:
- **Onboarding that works** ‚Äî get developers from zero to shipping in minutes, not weeks
- **Communities where real work happens** ‚Äî not just another Discord graveyard
- **Documentation people actually read** ‚Äî because wall-of-text GitHub READMEs aren't cutting it
- **APIs that don't make you want to scream** ‚Äî intuitive, well-documented, actually functional

Also, we run **hackathons** that bring actual value instead of abandoned repositories.

## Why developers hate your project (and how we fix it)

### üî• The brutal truth
- Your quickstart guide takes 3 hours to complete
- Your error messages are cryptic AF
- Your community channels are full of tumbleweeds
- Nobody knows how to actually use your "revolutionary" technology

### ‚ö° What we do about it
- **Radical simplification** ‚Äî from First Principles
- **Real-world examples** ‚Äî not toy demos that break in production
- **Human-readable errors** ‚Äî because `Error: undefined` helps nobody
- **Communities that actually help** ‚Äî where senior devs mentor newcomers instead of gatekeeping

We've seen too many great projects die because their developer experience was garbage. Don't let yours be one of them.
